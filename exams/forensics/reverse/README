The game is simple. This directory contains four programs.
Each of them prints "Congratulations" if run with the right parameters.
Your goal is to find such parameters. For instance, if newbie prints
"Congratulations" when executed with:
 ./newbie ABCD
Then the solution of that binary (and the key to decrypt the next one) is ABCD
