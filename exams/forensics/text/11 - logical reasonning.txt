Logical Reasoning

"Excellent!" I cried.
"Elementary" said he.
It is one of those instances where the reasoner can produce an
efect which seems remarkable to his neighbor, because the latter
has missed the one little point which is the basis of the deduction

Three Ways of Reasoning


Given:
1. A series of fact known as pre-conditions or premises
2. A fact known as conclusion
3. A rule that link the two together, such that the pre-conditions implies the
conclusion



Given:
1. A series of fact known as pre-conditions or premises
2. A fact known as conclusion
3. A rule that link the two together, such that the pre-conditions implies the
conclusion



We can identify three ways of reasoning


Deduction – determining the conclusion given the premises



Induction – learning the rule given premises and conclusions



Abduction – suggest the pre-conditions given the conclusions

Deduction


Normally associated with Mathematical Reasoning



The truth of the conclusion is a logical consequence of the premises




If the argument is valid and the premises are true,
the conclusion must be true as well
Unfortunately, in real life, it is hard to have absolute rules and fact
When it rains, the grass gets wet
Today it rained
Therefore the grass must be wet

Induction




Normally associated to Scientific Reasoning
Try to determine the relationship between facts by observing multiple
examples of premises followed by the same conclusion


Make generalization based on single instances



How many observations do you need to achieve reasonable certainty?



An inductive argument is never true or false, but it can be strong or weak
Every times it rains, the grass always gets wet
Therefore, if it rains, the grass will get wet

Abduction


Normally associated to medical or Detective Reasoning



The process of formulating hypothesis to explain a given observation




There could be other possible explanations as well,
so the idea is to find the best possible one
How can you choose the “best” explanation?

When it rains, the grass gets wet
The grass is now wet, therefore it *might* have rained

Occam's Razor
“Entities should not be multiplied unnecessarily”


The best possible explanation is often defined in terms of simplicity,
economy, succinctness, and elegance


Between many possible hypotheses (all with the same explanatory power),
choose the one that is more simple and require less assumptions

Putting Everything Together
[Induction] Transforming observations into knowledge


From multiple events, extract recurring patterns

[Abduction] Forming the Hypothesis


From an observation, think about the most likely explanations

[Deduction] Using the hypothesis to deduce other events


By verifying the predictions it is possible to rule out bad hypothesis

Conclusions can be supported by observations but they can be rarely “proved”
